# Interactive Win Page
A webpage you can use in your games or other projects to congratulate the user for achieving a goal in a fun and interactive way! You can change every text to your own to send your personalised message!
## How to use
The first part (Are you ready?) is required because the user needs to interact with the page before it can start playing music.

In the main screen the button in the top left corner adds another flying text to the screen and the button next to it boosts the speed of one random text.
